***Abstract—*** RSA cryptosystem is one of the most common encryption and decryption algorithms. In conjunction with other encryption schemes, RSA encryption is often used to prove the authenticity and integrity of messages. Due to its less efficient and resource-intensive nature, it is not generally used to encrypt entire messages or files. In order to break RSA, it is important for attackers to be able to factorize large prime numbers; with the advent of quantum computing, this factoring problem is losing its relevance. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether a correlation exists between the number of primes used and the algorithm's level of security. Classical RSA involves the use of two prime numbers for the process of key generation. In this paper, we propose a generalized algorithm for generating RSA keys using N distinct prime numbers. Papers have been published on the RSA algorithm subject to changing the number of primes in the RSA modulus. However, the aim of this paper is to generalize this approach while simultaneously illustrating the changes in the classical algorithm's properties over a spectrum of values for n
